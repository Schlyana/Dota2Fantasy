We want to do a fantasy league to a computer game called Dota 2. A user should be able to create a fantasy league and invite friends. A user should be able to create a team and add Dota 2 players to that team, then depending on the Dota 2 players results in various tournaments the user gets a certain score.

Technological specification:
(1) React

We will use WebPack for automation. We will use MongoDB to store user information and player statistics, to use MongoDB we will use a API called Mongoskin. We will be using the Steam WebAPI to get player statistics. We will use React-Bootstrap to get nice design and some javascript chart library like ChartJS, we have currently not decided which one to use. We will use Google Authentication so that people can log in to our site.
